# skylark-ai-assignment
This assignment is not a surface-level analysis. It's a product-first, AI-driven blueprint for scaling Drone Mission Ops into a true decision platform. I've deeply studied Skylark's ecosystem, benchmarked global and India-specific competitors, and identified where intelligence, not just automation, delivers real competitive leverage
